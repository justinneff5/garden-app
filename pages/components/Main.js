                    </h1>
                    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Rain gardens are designed to capture rain water and prevent the rapid release of excess stormwater into municipal water systems. Well designed rain gardens are well known to reduce runoff and flooding, and filter pollutants carried in stormwater runoff. Along with the municipal benefits and the conservation of water as a valuable natural resource, rain gardens create excellent habitats for birds and butterflies. Anyone can create a rain garden in their backyard, as rain gardens are typically low cost, low maintenance, and donâ€™t require a lot of space.
